    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: 2025-09-15</p>

    <p>We respect your privacy. This policy explains what data <strong>Match FEAR</strong> (“the Game”) processes and why.</p>

    <h2>What we process</h2>
	<p>When you choose to sign in, the Game uses <em>Epic Online Services (EOS)</em> to authenticate you for leaderboards. We collect only what is necessary to provide these features, such as an account identifier and your leaderboard entries.</p>

    <h2>How we use data</h2>
	<p>The Game uses player data to provide leaderboards (including friends leaderboards where available). Future versions of the Game might use player data for achievement tracking or in-game rewards.</p>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
	<p>We share data only with service providers needed to run the Game (for example, EOS for authentication and leaderboards). Each provider processes data under its own terms and privacy notices. We do not sell player data. We may disclose data if required by law or necessary to comply with legal process.</p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <p>Usage of leaderboards is completely optional. You can sign out at any time from the in-game menu.</p>

    <h2>Epic Online Services (EOS)</h2>
	<p>We use EOS for sign-in and leaderboards. To provide these features, the Game sends an account identifier and your leaderboard submissions to EOS.</p>
	<p>EOS is provided by Epic Games. Epic processes any information it receives under its own terms and privacy notices. Please see Epic’s <a href="https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/epicgames/privacy-policy" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> and your Epic Account settings for details, including how to manage or revoke this Game’s access.</p>

	<h2>Contacting us</h2>
	<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or would like to make a data protection inquiry, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:radiantwolfgames@gmail.com">radiantwolfgames@gmail.com</a>.</p>

	<h2>Updates and Revisions</h2>
	<p>We’ll update our privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, law, our business operations, or any other reason we determine is necessary or appropriate. When we do make changes, we’ll update the “Last Modified” date at the top of the policy and post it. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be posted on our website and will become effective immediately upon posting.</p>
